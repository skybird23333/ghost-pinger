# This project is useless
you need admin to invite the bot(and bot needs admin because it breaks i think)

## !jarvis, activate the sus
Your message will be reacted with an emote.
The bot will now start ghost pinging the target(send msg and delete) in all the random channels. Make sure it can send messages in all of them.
